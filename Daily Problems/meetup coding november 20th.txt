1) Are two strings anagrams?
	1b) group strings by anagrams

make an array of size 26 a-z, make them all 0
every time there is an occurence of the corresponding letter increment by 1
, then compare the first array to the second array. Sort the array based on counts

use a map for 1b
use a map to compare each possible anagram

2) kth element of two sorted arrays
	2b) n sorted arrays
use a max heap with k number of sorted arrays
put every single element in the sorted arrays into the max heap
max heap of the smallest elements

3)validate a binary search tree
