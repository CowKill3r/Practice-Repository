#Using a read7() method that returns 7 characters from a file, 
#implement readN(n) which reads n characters.

#For example, given a file with the content “Hello world”, 
#three read7() returns “Hello w”, “orld” and then “”.

def read7():
	
	#test file string 
	inf = "Hello world"
	print (inf)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    read7()
